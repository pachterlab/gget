    """
    Generates natural language text based on a given prompt using the OpenAI API's 'openai.ChatCompletion.create' endpoint.

    Parameters:
    - prompt (str):             The input prompt to generate text from.
    - api_key (str):            Your OpenAI API key (see: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
    - model (str):              The name of the GPT model to use for generating the text. Default is "gpt-3.5-turbo".
                                See https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4 for more information on the available models.
    - temperature (float)       Value between 0 and 2 that controls the level of randomness and creativity in the generated text.
                                Higher values result in more creative and varied text. Default is 1.
    - top_p (float)             Controls the diversity of the generated text as an alternative to sampling with temperature.
                                Higher values result in more diverse and unexpected text. Default is 1.
                                Note: OpenAI recommends altering this or temperature but not both.
    - stop (str)                A sequence of tokens to mark the end of the generated text. Default is None.
    - max_tokens (int)          Controls the maximum length of the generated text, in tokens. Default is 200.
    - presence_penalty (float)  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Higher values result increase the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
                                Default is 0.
    - frequency_penalty (float) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Higher values decrease the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
                                Default is 0.
    - logit_bias (dict)         A dictionary that specifies a bias towards certain tokens in the generated text. Default is None.
    - out (str)                 If provided, saves the generated text to a file with the specified path. Default is None.
    - verbose                   True/False whether to print progress information. Default True.

    Returns:
    - A string containing the generated text.
