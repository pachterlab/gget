    Query RCSB PDB for the protein structutre/metadata of a given PDB ID.

    Args:
    - pdb_id        PDB ID to be queried (str), e.g. "7S7U".
    - resource      Defines type of information to be returned.
                    "pdb": Returns the protein structure in PDB format (default).
                    "entry": Information about PDB structures at the top level of PDB structure hierarchical data organization.
                    "pubmed": Get PubMed annotations (data integrated from PubMed) for a given entry's primary citation.
                    "assembly": Information about PDB structures at the quaternary structure level.
                    "branched_entity": Get branched entity description (define entity ID as "identifier").
                    "nonpolymer_entity": Get non-polymer entity data (define entity ID as "identifier").
                    "polymer_entity": Get polymer entity data (define entity ID as "identifier").
                    "uniprot": Get UniProt annotations for a given macromolecular entity (define entity ID as "identifier").
                    "branched_entity_instance": Get branched entity instance description (define chain ID as "identifier").
                    "polymer_entity_instance": Get polymer entity instance (a.k.a chain) data (define chain ID as "identifier").
                    "nonpolymer_entity_instance": Get non-polymer entity instance description (define chain ID as "identifier").
    -  identifier   Can be used to define assembly, entity or chain ID if applicable (default: None).
                    Assembly/entity IDs are numbers (e.g. 1), and chain IDs are letters (e.g. "A").
    - save          True/False wether to save JSON/PDB with query results in the current working directory (default: False).

    Returns requested information in JSON format (except for resource="pdb" which returns protein structure in PDB format).
