**Version ≥ 0.27.6** (May 1, 2023) (YANKED):

- Updated [`gget info`](./info.md) with new flags `uniprot` and `ncbi` which allow turning off results from these databases independently to save runtime (note: flag `ensembl_only` was deprecated)

**Version ≥ 0.27.4** (March 19, 2023):  
- New module: [`gget gpt`](./gpt.md)  

**Version ≥ 0.27.3** (March 11, 2023):  
- [`gget info`](./info.md) excludes PDB IDs by default to increase speed (PDB results can be included using flag `--pdb` / `pdb=True`).  

**Version ≥ 0.27.2** (January 1, 2023):    
- Updated [`gget alphafold`](./alphafold.md) to [DeepMind's AlphaFold v2.3.0](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/releases/tag/v2.3.0) (including new arguments `multimer_for_monomer` and `multimer_recycles`)  

**Version ≥ 0.27.0** (December 10, 2022):  
- Updated [`gget alphafold`](./alphafold.md) to match recent changes by DeepMind  
- Updated version number to match [gget's creator](https://github.com/lauraluebbert)'s age following a long-standing Pachter lab tradition  

**Version ≥ 0.3.13** (November 11, 2022):  
- Reduced runtime for [`gget enrichr`](./enrichr.md) and [`gget archs4`](./archs4.md) when used with Ensembl IDs  

**Version ≥ 0.3.12** (November 10, 2022):  
- [`gget info`](./info.md) now also returns subcellular localisation data from UniProt
- New [`gget info`](./info.md) flag `ensembl_only` returns only Ensembl results
- Reduced runtime for [`gget info`](./info.md) and [`gget seq`](./seq.md)

**Version ≥ 0.3.11** (September 7, 2022):  
- New module: [`gget pdb`](./pdb.md)  

**Version ≥ 0.3.10** (September 2, 2022):  
- [`gget alphafold`](./alphafold.md) now also returns pLDDT values for generating plots from output without rerunning the program (also see the [gget alphafold FAQ](https://github.com/pachterlab/gget/discussions/39))

**Version ≥ 0.3.9** (August 25, 2022):  
- Updated openmm installation instructions for [`gget alphafold`](./alphafold.md)  

**Version ≥ 0.3.8** (August 12, 2022):  
- Fixed mysql-connector-python version requirements

**Version ≥ 0.3.7** (August 9, 2022):  
- **NOTE:** The [Ensembl FTP site](http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/) changed its structure on August 8, 2022. Please upgrade to `gget` version ≥ 0.3.7 if you use [`gget ref`](./ref.md)  

**Version ≥ 0.3.5** (August 6, 2022):  
- New module: [`gget alphafold`](./alphafold.md)  

**Version ≥ 0.2.6** (July 7, 2022):  
- [`gget ref`](./ref.md) now supports plant genomes! 🌱  

**Version ≥ 0.2.5** (June 30, 2022):  
- **NOTE:** [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) changed the structure of their API on June 28, 2022. Please upgrade to `gget` version ≥ 0.2.5 if you use any of the modules querying data from UniProt ([`gget info`](./info.md) and [`gget seq`](./seq.md)).

**Version ≥ 0.2.3:** (June 26, 2022):  
- JSON is now the default output format for the command-line interface for modules that previously returned data frame (CSV) format by default (the output can be converted to data frame/CSV using flag `[-csv][--csv]`). Data frame/CSV remains the default output for Jupyter Lab / Google Colab (and can be converted to JSON with `json=True`).
- For all modules, the first required argument was converted to a positional argument and should not be named anymore in the command-line, e.g. `gget ref -s human` &rarr; `gget ref human`.
- `gget info`: `[--expand]` is deprecated. The module will now always return all of the available information.
- Slight changes to the output returned by `gget info`, including the return of versioned Ensembl IDs.
- `gget info` and `gget seq` now support 🪱 WormBase and 🪰 FlyBase IDs.
- `gget archs4` and `gget enrichr` now also take Ensembl IDs as input with added flag `[-e][--ensembl]` (`ensembl=True` in Jupyter Lab / Google Colab).
- `gget seq` argument `seqtype` was replaced by flag `[-t][--translate]` (`translate=True/False` in Jupyter Lab / Google Colab) which will return either nucleotide (`False`) or amino acid (`True`) sequences.
- `gget search` argument `seqtype` was renamed to `id_type` for clarity (still taking the same arguments 'gene' or 'transcript').
