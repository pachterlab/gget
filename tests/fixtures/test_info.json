Antagonizes the D1-like dopamine receptor dop-1 to negatively regulate the rate of locomotion (PubMed:15378064). Negatively regulates locomotion through the activation of goa-1 subunit proteins which inactivates the unc-77/nca-1 and nca-2 ion-channels in the command interneurons (PubMed:28968387). Inhibits early-stage swimming by modulating the unc-77/nca-1 and nca-2 ion channels of premotor interneurons (PubMed:33796839). In GABAergic, RIC, and SIA neurons, antagonizes the function of dop-1 to play a role in behavioral plasticity and regulate the decision-making process when conflicting alternatives are present (PubMed:25536037). Antagonizes octopamine signaling in response to food by promoting the dopamine-mediated suppression of crh-1/CREB1 transcription factor activation in cholinergic SIA neurons (PubMed:19609300). This is most likely in association with the G(o)-alpha G-protein subunit goa-1 (PubMed:19609300).

Binds to low-density lipid receptor family members: low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), apolipoprotein E receptor (LRP1/APOER) and apolipoprotein receptor 2 (LRP8/APOER2), and promotes their degradation in intracellular acidic compartments (PubMed:18039658). Acts via a non-proteolytic mechanism to enhance the degradation of the hepatic LDLR through a clathrin LDLRAP1/ARH-mediated pathway. May prevent the recycling of LDLR from endosomes to the cell surface or direct it to lysosomes for degradation. Can induce ubiquitination of LDLR leading to its subsequent degradation (PubMed:17461796, PubMed:18197702, PubMed:18799458, PubMed:22074827). Inhibits intracellular degradation of APOB via the autophagosome/lysosome pathway in a LDLR-independent manner. Involved in the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway (PubMed:18660751). Inhibits epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC)-mediated Na(+) absorption by reducing ENaC surface expression primarily by increasing its proteasomal degradation. Regulates neuronal apoptosis via modulation of LRP8/APOER2 levels and related anti-apoptotic signaling pathways",
